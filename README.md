# Breast-Cancer-Detection
This project presents a method for attempting to identify the presence of breast cancer using collected patient data.  The set used is the UCI (Wisconsin) Breast Cancer Dataset holding records which contains 569 patient records from hospital cases.  Each instance contains 10 quantitative features to describe the patient with a total of 30 features.  We first prepared and pruned the data using LASSO regularization to identify nine relevant features.  Next, we evaluated two classification models: Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine (SVM) learning.  The logistic regression achieved an F1 score of 0.9701 compared with SVM which only scored 0.9630.  This suggests that linear models provide a better fit and more accurate predictions for breast cancer prediction tasks. However, with consideration towards evaluation metrics such as recall, the SVM model provided a better recall score of 0.9701 and may be better moving forward.
